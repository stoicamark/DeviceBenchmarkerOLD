* battery info (level, charging, discharging time)
* device memory size
* network connection type (wifi, cellular, other)

The library uses only the browser API for gathering all the informations needed for scoring.

You can pull it to your project easily: `npm install devmarker` <br>
And you can also add it to your project dependencies: `npm install devmarker --save` <br>
